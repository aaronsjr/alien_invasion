1. **Finish adding the button**
    - Get the game to run when the button is clicked.

2. **Add explosions into the game**
    - Will need to create a new file (explosion.py) and use it to store and Explosion class
    - Need to put the call to the sprite draw method in the '_update_screen' method
    - Could have animations - would need to split them up into different frames.
